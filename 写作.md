* summary: 有几个出口，有几个房价
* （整体需要）介绍出口和房间的位置，以及逃生路线的数目
* Body 1: Fire Exit A，+逃生路线。Body 2: Fire Exit B, **Lift**

This is a map which introduces how to escape from emergency situation for students living in the second floor of the accommodation.

There are two fire exits in the second floor. The exit A is located on the west of the building, while the exit B is located on the northeast of the building. Students living in the six bedrooms in the second floor can escape through the two ways.

The Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2 and Bedroom 3 are nearby the fire exit A, which means people in those rooms could escape from fire through the stairs in the fire exit A and meet at the meeting point 1. The Bedroom 1 and Bedroom 2 are located on the northwest of the building, students in those rooms can turn right and go through the corridor to escape, while escape students in the Bedroom 3 need to turn left and go straight until reaching the fire exit A.

The Bedroom 4, Bedroom 5 and Bedroom 6 are nearby the fire exit B. The Bedroom 4 and Bedroom 6 are opposite the fire exit B, which means students in those rooms can go straight on to escape. However, the Bedroom 5 is on the east of stairs and fire exit B, which means students in the Bedroom 5 need to turn right and run back to escape. After escaping form the fire exit B, students can meet at the meeting point 2.



该作文的语法和表述都比较地道，但有一些小错误需要指出：

1. "escape from emergency situation" 可以改为 "escape from an emergency situation"，因为 "emergency situation" 是一个特定的事物，需要加上冠词。
2. "Students living in the six bedrooms in the second floor" 可以改为 "Students living in the six bedrooms on the second floor"，因为 "on" 更适合用于描述楼层。
3. "which means people in those rooms could escape from fire through the stairs in the fire exit A and meet at the meeting point 1" 可以改为 "which means people in those rooms could escape from the fire through the stairs in fire exit A and meet at meeting point 1"，因为 "the" 不需要用于描述 "fire"，而 "meeting point" 是一个特定的事物，也不需要加上冠词。
4. "students in those rooms can turn right and go through the corridor to escape, while escape students in the Bedroom 3 need to turn left and go straight until reaching the fire exit A" 可以改为 "students in those rooms can turn right and go through the corridor to escape, while students in Bedroom 3 need to turn left and go straight until they reach fire exit A"，因为 "escape" 不需要用作动词，而 "Bedroom 3" 是一个特定的房间，不需要加上冠词。
5. "students in the Bedroom 5 need to turn right and run back to  escape" 可以改为 "students in Bedroom 5 need to turn right and run back to escape through fire exit B"，因为需要说明他们需要通过哪个出口逃生。

Art classes, like painting and drawing, are not as important as other subjects, so some people think that it should not be a compulsory subject at high school. To what extent do you agree or disagree

* assistant:

Art classes, such as painting and drawing, have been a part of the **school curriculum** for many years. However, some people argue that these classes are not as important as other subjects and **should not be compulsory** in high school. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement and believe that art classes should remain a compulsory subject in high school.

Firstly, art classes provide students with **a creative outlet** (出口) that is not found in other subjects. **Art allows students to express themselves in a way that is unique to them**, and it encourages them to think outside the box. This type of creative thinking is essential in today's world, where **innovation and problem-solving are highly valued**.

Secondly, art classes can help students **develop important skills** that are transferable to other subjects. For example, drawing and painting require **a great deal of patience and attention** to detail, which can be applied to subjects such as science and mathematics. Additionally, art classes can help students develop their **spatial awareness and hand-eye coordination**, which are important skills in fields such as engineering and architecture.

Finally, art classes can have **a positive impact** on **students' mental health and well-being**. Creating art can be a therapeutic activity that helps students **manage stress and anxiety**. It can also provide **a sense of accomplishment** and **boost self-esteem**, which can have a positive impact on academic performance.

In conclusion, art classes should remain a compulsory subject in high school. They provide students with a creative outlet, develop important skills, and have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. While other subjects may be deemed more important, art classes are essential in fostering creativity and innovation, which are crucial in today's world.

Introduction:
In recent times, there has been ongoing debate about whether art classes such as painting and drawing should remain a compulsory subject in high schools. While some believe that these subjects are not as essential as others and hence should not be mandatory, others argue otherwise. In this essay, I will express my agreement with the opinion that art classes should not be made compulsory.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the primary reasons why I agree with the viewpoint is that every student does not have an interest in studying fine arts. Each individual possesses different skills and interests. Some may excel in science, mathematics, literature or social sciences; whereas, others might find it challenging to comprehend intricate concepts and formulas related to these subjects. By making art classes a compulsory part of the curriculum, we force students who lack passion for art to attend lectures they aren't interested in. This situation can lead to boredom, disinterest, poor performance, and ultimately low grades - all because they were forced into a discipline which did not align with their goals and aspirations.

Body Paragraph 2:
Secondly, a significant portion of students from underprivileged backgrounds often struggle to pursue higher education due to financial constraints. They prefer taking up vocational courses, trade-oriented jobs, or entrepreneurship after completing high school. For them, gaining knowledge in subjects such as applied electronics, carpentry, accountancy, marketing etc., could prove more beneficial than learning how to draw still life images. Therefore, by imposing the study of art upon such students, we limit their ability to focus on areas that would eventually help them secure better job prospects. Moreover, providing more opportunities for specialized training at secondary level itself enables young adults to enter workforce quickly without incurring college tuition fees.

Conclusion:
To conclude, while appreciating the importance of art classes for those inclined towards visual arts, I strongly advocate that they shouldn't be imposed upon everyone. It's crucial to recognize tha

* 失去对父母的信任：Lose trust in parents.
* 肉体惩罚：Physical punishment.

One important stage in a child's growth is certainly the development of a  conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong. This skill comes  with time and good parenting, and my firm conviction is that punishment does not  have much of a role to play in this. Therefore I have to disagree almost entirely with  the given statement. 

To some extent the question depends on the age of the child. To punish a very  young child is both wrong and foolish, as an infant will not understand what is  happening or why he or she is being punished. Once the age of reason is reached  however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and discouraged from bad.  This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might  entail many negative consequences unintended by the parents. 

To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents  should firstly provide good role modelling in their own behaviour. After that, if  sanctions are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that  merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones  - an outcome which may well result in the child starting to bully others. Nor should  the punishment be in any way cruel. 

Rather, teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to discipline their young  charges, such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out. Making the  punishment fit the crime is a useful notion, which would see children being made to  pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologise  to someone they have hurt. In these ways responsibility is developed in the child,  which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.

As the result of the development of nuclear technology, whether nuclear technology is beneficial has become a hot topic. In my opinion, nuclear technology is a blessing in most of time. 

On the one hand, it is some people believed that nuclear technology is a cursing. The nuclear waste in plant once being leaked out, it can cause financial loss because the plant would be abandoned for a while. And this would make people and animals exposed to radiation and leading to many incurable sicknesses. 

On the other hand, the nuclear technology can be a blessing. Firstly, nuclear plants are effective in generating electricities and are sustainable to help the shortage of fossil fuels. Besides, nuclear technology provides greener power with less pollution. Unlike fossil fuels, it doesn't produce a lot of greenhouse gas, such as carbon dioxide. Secondly, in the area of medical treatment, it can cure complex diseases such as cancers by killing the cancer cells. Without the technology, patients may die. 

However, nuclear waste leaking seldom happens. During the past 100 years in which the nuclear technology has been used, it happens less than 5 times. And I do believe it won't take place many times in the future because the workers in nuclear plants are professional and would strictly follow the instruction, and the leaders in big countries where hold the nuclear weapons are rational. 

In conclusion, I do believe, the nuclear technology is a blessing. It is a blessing in generating electricity and medical care. And it is the low frequency using of nuclear weapon an nuclear waste leakage.

## study

It is a hot topic what students need to study in the university. Some believe that students need to study useful things in the future, while others argue that it is necessary to study things they like. In my opinion, students need to major in useful subjects in the future.

Some people believe that studying useful things help students to get better academic performance. It is evidenced that if students major in the subjects they like, they would spend more time on study and get better grades. However, students could enjoy more benefits from studying useful things in the future.

On the one hand, studying useful things such as engineering and medicine, is beneficial to students to get higher salaries. With useful knowledge and technique skills,  students could finish the task in working quickly. And companies are willing to pay more to hire this kind of student because they do not need to spend money and time to teach the skills. Besides, they have more opportunities to have higher-paid jobs such as IT engineers, Doctors, and lawyers. With higher salaries, students can enjoy a better life in the future.

Besides, useful things, such as engineering, medicine, and law, are necessary for the development of our society. If more students study useful things such as medicine, there will be more doctors and sick people would not wait for a long time for medical care. With more engineers, technology such as ChatGPT, can also develop quickly and make our life more convenient. 

In conclusion, I do believe that students need to study useful things. It is not only beneficial to students themselves to get higher payments but also beneficial to the development of our society.

plz write IETLS task 2: Schools should concentrate on teaching students the academic subjects that will be useful for their future careers. Subjects such as music and sports are not useful. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (agree)

assistant:

In today's competitive world, it is essential for schools to focus on teaching academic subjects that will be useful for students' future careers. While subjects such as music and sports may have their benefits, they are not as important as academic subjects. Therefore, I agree with the statement that schools should concentrate on teaching students academic subjects that will be useful for their future careers.

Firstly, academic subjects such as mathematics, science, and language are essential for students to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are crucial for success in any career, and without a strong foundation in these subjects, students may struggle to excel in their chosen field.

Secondly, in today's job market, employers are looking for candidates with specific skills and knowledge. Therefore, it is essential for schools to provide students with the necessary education and training to meet the demands of the job market. Focusing on academic subjects that are relevant to the job market will help students to be better prepared for their future careers.

While music and sports may have their benefits, they are not as important as academic subjects. These subjects may provide students with physical and emotional benefits, but they do not provide the necessary skills and knowledge required for success in the job market.

In conclusion, schools should concentrate on teaching students academic subjects that will be useful for their future careers. While music and sports may have their benefits, they are not as important as academic subjects. By focusing on academic subjects, schools can better prepare students for success in the job market and help them to achieve their career goals.

Task 2: Some people think that the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Education is an essential aspect of a child's life, and schools play a crucial role in shaping their future. Some people believe that the primary purpose of schools is to prepare children to become good citizens and workers, while others argue that schools should focus on benefiting children as individuals. In my opinion, schools should aim to benefit children as individuals while also preparing them to become responsible citizens and workers.

Firstly, schools should prioritize the individual needs of children. Every child is unique, and schools should cater to their individual needs and interests. Children have different talents, abilities, and learning styles, and schools should provide a diverse range of opportunities to help them discover their strengths and interests. This will not only benefit the child as an individual but also contribute to their overall development and success in life.

Secondly, schools should also prepare children to become responsible citizens and workers. Schools should teach children about their civic duties and responsibilities, such as respecting the law, participating in community service, and being environmentally conscious. Additionally, schools should provide children with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the workforce, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.

In conclusion, while the primary purpose of schools is to prepare children to become good citizens and workers, schools should also prioritize the individual needs of children. By providing a diverse range of opportunities and preparing children for their future roles in society, schools can benefit children as individuals while also contributing to their overall development and success.

plz write IETLS task 2: As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

assistant:

In recent years, the use of computers in education has increased significantly. Some people argue that this trend will eventually lead to the elimination of teachers in the classroom. In my opinion, while computers can be a valuable tool in education, they cannot replace the role of teachers.

Firstly, computers are excellent at providing information and delivering content. They can be used to present information in an engaging and interactive way, and can provide students with access to a vast amount of resources. However, computers cannot replace the human interaction that takes place in a classroom. Teachers are not just sources of information, but also mentors, role models, and guides. They provide students with feedback, encouragement, and support, which are essential for their development.

Secondly, computers are not capable of adapting to the individual needs of each student. Teachers, on the other hand, can tailor their teaching methods to suit the learning style and pace of each student. They can identify areas where a student is struggling and provide additional support and guidance. This level of personalization is not possible with computers.

Finally, teachers play a crucial role in developing social skills and emotional intelligence in students. They create a safe and supportive environment where students can learn to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and develop empathy and respect for others. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and in life, and cannot be developed through the use of computers alone.

In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool in education, they cannot replace the role of teachers. Teachers provide students with much more than just information, and their role in developing social skills and emotional intelligence is essential. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the idea that there will be no role for teachers in the classroom in the future.

plz write IETLS task 2: nowadays some individuals behave in an anti-society way, such as committing a crime. In general, it is the society to blame. What causes the anti-social behaviors of individuals? Who should be responsible for dealing with it?

assistant:

Task 2:

In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of individuals who exhibit anti-social behavior, such as committing crimes. While some people believe that society is to blame for this trend, others argue that individuals are responsible for their actions. This essay will explore the causes of anti-social behavior and who should be responsible for dealing with it.

One of the main causes of anti-social behavior is poverty. People who live in poverty-stricken areas often lack access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and education. This can lead to frustration and desperation, which can result in criminal behavior. Additionally, individuals who grow up in dysfunctional families or have experienced trauma may also be more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior.

While society may play a role in creating the conditions that lead to anti-social behavior, individuals must take responsibility for their actions. People have agency and the ability to make choices, and they must be held accountable for the choices they make. This means that individuals who commit crimes should be punished for their actions.

However, it is not enough to simply punish individuals who exhibit anti-social behavior. Society as a whole must also take responsibility for addressing the root causes of this behavior. This includes providing access to education, healthcare, and other basic necessities, as well as addressing issues such as poverty and inequality. Additionally, law enforcement and the justice system must work to prevent crime and rehabilitate individuals who have committed crimes.

In conclusion, while there are many factors that contribute to anti-social behavior, individuals must take responsibility for their actions. At the same time, society as a whole must work to address the root causes of this behavior and provide support and resources to prevent it from occurring in the first place. Only by working together can we create a safer and more just society for all.
