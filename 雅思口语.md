Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted

* I'd like to talk about a trip I took to Beijing a few years ago. It's a city that's famous for its historical landmarks and cultural attractions, but unfortunately, it's also known for having some of the worst air pollution in the world.

  When I arrived in Beijing, I immediately noticed that the air quality was very poor. The sky was hazy and gray, and there was a strong smell of exhaust fumes and industrial emissions. Even though I was only there for a few days, I could feel the effects of the pollution on my health. My throat felt scratchy and my eyes were irritated, and I had to wear a face mask whenever I went outside.

  Despite the pollution, I still tried to make the most of my trip.

Describe an unusual meal you had

* Last year, I went on a trip to Thailand with some friends and we decided to try some of the local street food. One evening, we stumbled upon a small food stall that was selling fried insects. At first, I was hesitant to try them, but my friends convinced me to give it a go.

  The vendor had a variety of insects to choose from, including crickets, grasshoppers, and silk worms. I decided to try the crickets, which were seasoned with chili powder and salt. The vendor fried them up in a wok and served them in a small paper bag.

  To be honest, I was a bit nervous as I took my first bite, but I was pleasantly surprised. The crickets had a crunchy texture and a slightly nutty flavor. They were also quite spicy, which I enjoyed.

  Overall, it was definitely an unusual meal, but I'm glad I tried it. It was a unique cultural experience and it opened my mind to trying new foods in the future.
