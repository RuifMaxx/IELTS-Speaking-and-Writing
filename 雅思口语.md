### An interesting old man (派对认识，时尚，想共事，鼓舞你做有趣事情)

I met this fascinating old man at a party a few months ago. He was in his late 70s, but he looked much younger than his age. He was wearing a stylish suit and a colorful tie that caught my attention. We started chatting, and I soon realized that he was not only fashionable but also very knowledgeable and witty.

He told me that he used to work as a fashion designer in his youth and had traveled to many countries to showcase his creations. He showed me some pictures of his designs, and I was impressed by his creativity and originality. He also shared some stories about his adventures and misadventures in the fashion industry, which were both hilarious and insightful.

As we talked more, he expressed his interest in collaborating with me on a project that involved promoting sustainable fashion and empowering young designers. He said that he had seen my work online and was impressed by my vision and skills. I was thrilled to hear that and felt honored to be considered by such a seasoned professional.

Before we parted ways, he surprised me by asking me to dance with him. I was a bit hesitant at first, but he insisted and said that he wanted to show me some moves that he had learned in his travels. We danced to a lively tune, and I must say that he was a fantastic dancer. He made me laugh and feel alive, and I realized that age is just a number when it comes to having fun and enjoying life.

Overall, meeting this interesting old man was a memorable experience that taught me a lot about fashion, creativity, and living life to the fullest. I hope to stay in touch with him and learn more from his wisdom and humor.

### Dress

He often wears a sweater with a big logo in front, tight pants together with  leather shoes. Sometimes he would also put on bright color t-shirts and  shorts in summer, athletic shoes to go with it. By the way, he usually  changes his hair colors to better match his dressing style. 

While i am accustomed to dress myself in simple t-shirts and a casual pair of jeans, she is always into sportswear or gray hoodies with loose pants. She thinks comfort comes the first  comparing to the look or the the pursuit of so-called limited edition / luxurious brands.  Sometimes she would add some accessories such as sports bag or a cap to make herself appear more leisurely. In my mind, this is her real style, but actually i was wrong, coz there was once when we had an anniversary of …, she showed up with a fancy dress, her figure was more than perfect, necklace shining in the light, that was the first time i see her in another type of fashion

Fine feathers make fine birds

### Plant

As Anna’s roommate, we are with each other almost every day. It’s evident that she takes  more care of her appearance than anyone i am acquainted with. When she has an important  date, she can spend up to 2 hours considering and selecting what to wear.

Actually she wasn’t a fan of plantation until she planted an orange tree in a little pot. It  happened when i was 5 years old. At that time, we ate oranges together and my mom  suddenly suggested us to throw/leave some seeds into the soil and see what might  happen.  At first, we grew them together but not long after, i became bored with it, so i left it all  to my mom. What she did was mainly watering the seeds at times, but to our surprise,  the seeds erupted and stem came out fast. My mom was very proud of her efforts, since  then, it has become her hobby. I usually saw her search online about how to grow fruits.  With the help of professional knowledge, the little orange tree grew up more quickly and  turned to be a big one with the nurture of my mom.

### Late

Three years ago, I had a class at 8 o'clock, but I overslept and ended up being late. The reason was that I stayed up late the night before, probably until around 2 am, watching a movie with my friends. I didn't realize how late it was and didn't set an alarm, so I slept in until around 8 o'clock. When I woke up, I panicked and rushed to get dressed and grab my things. I didn't have time to eat breakfast or even brush my teeth properly.

When I arrived at the classroom, the professor had already started the lecture and everyone was seated. I tried to sneak in quietly, but the professor noticed me and stopped talking. He asked me why I was late and I had to admit that I overslept. He scolded me in front of the class and said that being late was disrespectful and disruptive. I felt embarrassed and regretful, and I apologized to him and my classmates.

After that incident, I learned my lesson and made sure to prioritize my sleep and set multiple alarms. I also made an effort to arrive early to class and show respect to my professors and peers.

### Friend

I would like to talk about my childhood friend, Peter. He was my classmate in elementary school and also my neighbor. We used to play ball together and had a lot of fun. Peter was a very friendly and outgoing person, and we got along very well. We used to explore the neighborhood together and often went on adventures to discover new things.

However, after we finished elementary school, we went to different schools, and our paths diverged. We were no longer in the same class, but we still kept in touch and met up occasionally. However, when we went to college, we lost touch and drifted apart. Although we had some great memories together, we moved on with our lives and pursued our own interests. I will always remember the good times we had, but I have come to accept that people grow apart, and that is a natural part of life.

### Childhood friend Swimming

When I was a kid, I used to hang out a lot with my childhood friend Oven. He was a year older than me and always seemed to know more about everything. One summer, when we were both around 10 or 11 years old, he offered to teach me how to swim in the neighborhood swimming pool.

At first, I was a bit hesitant because I had never been in a pool before and I was afraid of drowning. But Oven was very patient and reassuring. He showed me how to put on a pair of goggles and a nose clip, and how to float on my back while holding onto the edge of the pool. He also taught me how to kick my legs and move my arms in a freestyle stroke.

It took me a while to get the hang of it, but Oven was always there to encourage me and correct my mistakes. He would swim alongside me and hold my hand when I felt scared. He even let me use his kickboard and noodle to practice different techniques.

Thanks to Oven's guidance, I gradually became more confident and comfortable in the water. I learned how to dive, do somersaults, and even swim a few laps without stopping. It was a great feeling of accomplishment and I was grateful to have such a supportive friend.

Overall, I think Oven was a fantastic swimming coach and a true friend. He not only taught me a valuable life skill but also helped me overcome my fears and enjoy the water. I will always cherish those memories of our summer pool adventures.

### Actor

I really admire Elijah Jordan Wood, who is best known for his role as Frodo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He's a talented actor who has been in the industry for many years, and I think he's incredibly versatile and able to play a wide range of characters.

In terms of his appearance, Elijah has a very distinctive look. He's quite short, standing at only 5'6", but he has a very youthful and boyish face that makes him look much younger than his actual age. He has big blue eyes that are very expressive and a mop of curly brown hair that he often wears in a messy, tousled style.

Overall, I think Elijah is a very attractive and charismatic actor who has a lot of talent and range. He's definitely one of my favorites in the industry!

courage strength and dedication

### Late

I'd like to talk about a time when I was late for an important meeting. It happened when I was going to my university in Shandong for the first time. I had flown from Chengdu to Jinan, and then I needed to take a bus to the campus. Unfortunately, my flight was delayed due to bad weather, so I arrived at the bus station later than I had planned.

To make matters worse, I was feeling quite hungry and decided to grab a quick dinner at a nearby restaurant. However, the food turned out to be too salty and spicy for my taste, and I ended up with a stomachache that night. I didn't sleep well and woke up feeling weak and nauseous the next morning.

As a result, I missed the meeting that was scheduled for the first day of the semester. It was a crucial event where we were supposed to meet our professors and classmates, get our schedules, and learn about the rules and expectations of the university. I felt terrible about it and worried that I had already made a bad impression on my peers and teachers.

Fortunately, I was able to catch up with the information and make up for the lost time later. I learned to be more careful with my travel plans and food choices, and to always have a backup plan in case of unexpected delays or emergencies. It was a valuable lesson that helped me adapt to the new environment and become more responsible and resilient.

Do you like visiting art galleries?

* Well, I do enjoy photography as a hobby, but I don't think I have the talent or passion to pursue it as a career. While I appreciate the beauty and creativity of art, I personally find more fulfillment in other areas such as business or technology. However, I do believe that everyone should pursue their passions and interests, and if someone has a true calling to be an artist, they should absolutely go for it.

 Do you like modern art or traditional art?

* Personally, I prefer traditional art over modern art. I find traditional art to be more timeless and classic, with a rich history and cultural significance. On the other hand, I find modern art to be more abstract and difficult to understand. While I can appreciate the creativity and innovation of modern art, it doesn't resonate with me as much as traditional art does. However, I do believe that art is subjective and everyone has their own preferences, so what I like may not be the same as what others like.

Do you often wear jewelry?

* Yes, I do wear jewelry quite often. I usually wear a watch and a pair of earrings every day. On special occasions, I like to wear a necklace or a bracelet to complement my outfit. I think jewelry can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to one's appearance, and it can also be a way to express one's personal style and taste. However, I don't like to wear too much jewelry at once, as I believe that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.

Why do you think some people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time?

* I think there are several reasons why some people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time. Firstly, it could be sentimental value. For example, a piece of jewelry may have been passed down from a family member or given as a gift from a loved one, and wearing it can bring back fond memories and a sense of connection to that person. Secondly, it could be a matter of personal style. Some people have a signature piece of jewelry that they wear every day, such as a ring or a necklace, that has become a part of their identity. Lastly, it could be a matter of practicality. For example, a watch is a functional piece of jewelry that serves a purpose beyond just being an accessory, and people may wear it every day for its usefulness. Overall, I think people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time because it holds some sort of significance or value to them.

Have you ever learned about outer space and stars?

* Sure, I have always been fascinated by outer space and stars. I have read many books and watched documentaries about the universe, and I find it amazing how vast and mysterious it is. Learning about the different planets, galaxies, and black holes has always been a fascinating topic for me. I believe that there is still so much to discover and learn about the universe, and I am excited to continue exploring this topic in the future.

Are you interested in films concerning outer space and stars?

Overall, I think films about outer space and stars are a great way to expand our knowledge and imagination about the vastness of the universe.

Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted

* I'd like to talk about a trip I took to Beijing a few years ago. It's a city that's famous for its historical landmarks and cultural attractions, but unfortunately, it's also known for having some of the worst air pollution in the world.

  When I arrived in Beijing, I immediately noticed that the air quality was very poor. The sky was hazy and gray, and there was a strong smell of exhaust fumes and industrial emissions. Even though I was only there for a few days, I could feel the effects of the pollution on my health. My throat felt scratchy and my eyes were irritated, and I had to wear a face mask whenever I went outside.

  Despite the pollution, I still tried to make the most of my trip. I visited some of the famous landmarks like the Forbidden City and the Great Wall, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed that I couldn't fully enjoy the experience because of the air quality. It was a stark reminder of how important it is to take care of our environment and reduce our carbon footprint.

  Overall, my trip to Beijing was a memorable one, but for all the wrong reasons. It was a sobering reminder of the impact that human activity can have on the planet, and it made me more aware of the need to take action to protect our environment.

Describe a person who likes to dress well

* I'd like to talk about my friend Sarah, who is someone who really likes to dress well. She's always been interested in fashion and style, and she spends a lot of time and effort putting together her outfits.

  One thing that stands out about Sarah's style is that she's very confident and bold in her choices. She's not afraid to wear bright colors, bold patterns, or statement pieces that really make her stand out. At the same time, she also knows how to balance her outfits so that they're not too overwhelming or busy.

  Another thing I admire about Sarah's style is that she's very versatile. She can dress up for a formal event and look absolutely stunning in a cocktail dress and heels, but she can also rock a casual outfit with jeans and a t-shirt just as easily. She's always experimenting with different styles and trends, and she's not afraid to try something new.

  Overall, I think Sarah's love of fashion and her ability to dress well really reflects her personality. She's confident, creative, and always willing to take risks. Whenever I see her, I'm always impressed by how put-together and stylish she looks, and I think she's a great example of someone who knows how to express themselves through their clothing.

Describe an unusual meal you had

* Last year, I went on a trip to Thailand with some friends and we decided to try some of the local street food. One evening, we stumbled upon a small food stall that was selling fried insects. At first, I was hesitant to try them, but my friends convinced me to give it a go.

  The vendor had a variety of insects to choose from, including crickets, grasshoppers, and silk worms. I decided to try the crickets, which were seasoned with chili powder and salt. The vendor fried them up in a wok and served them in a small paper bag.

  To be honest, I was a bit nervous as I took my first bite, but I was pleasantly surprised. The crickets had a crunchy texture and a slightly nutty flavor. They were also quite spicy, which I enjoyed.

  Overall, it was definitely an unusual meal, but I'm glad I tried it. It was a unique cultural experience and it opened my mind to trying new foods in the future.

Describe a historical period you would like to know more about

* Chengdu is a city with a rich history, and one of the most interesting historical periods in its past is the Three Kingdoms period. This was a time of great political turmoil and military conflict in China, when three rival states were vying for control of the country. Chengdu was the capital of the Shu Han state, which was ruled by the famous warlord Liu Bei.

  During this period, Chengdu was a center of culture and learning, with many scholars and artists flocking to the city to escape the chaos of war. The city was also known for its advanced irrigation systems, which allowed farmers to cultivate the fertile land around the city and produce abundant crops.

  One of the most famous landmarks from this period is the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which was built in the 3rd century BC and is still in use today. This system was designed to control the flow of the Min River and prevent flooding, while also providing water for irrigation and drinking.

  Overall, the Three Kingdoms period was a fascinating time in Chengdu's history, marked by both conflict and cultural achievement. Today, visitors to the city can still see many relics and landmarks from this period, and learn more about the rich history of this ancient city.
